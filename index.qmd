# Project Abstract/Introduction
Caiya and Erin designed an interactive candy bucket inspired by the lovable dragon, Toothless, from the film *How to Train Your Dragon*. Taken from the iconic scene where Toothless places his snout on Hiccup's outstretched palm, the candy bucket opens its mouth when the nose is touched and plays a clip from the awe-inspiring theme song, "Test Drive".

![Scene from *How to Train Your Dragon of Toothless trusting Hiccup enough to touch his nose.]()
